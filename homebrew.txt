Homebrew is a package manager for Macs similar to apt or yum on Linux systems
It can be obtained here: https://brew.sh/

This guide is a modified version of that produced by Eddie Baron, supplemented
by official documentation from many sources.

In order to install homebrew, the following prerequisites must be met:

  1. Install Rossetta 2 via:
  
    % /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
    
  2. Install the xcode command line tools via:
  
    % xcode-select --install

Following the instructions on the Homebrew site, Homebrew can be installed via:
  
  % /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  
This will prompt you to confirm installation of several Homebrew files. After the installation finishes,
you will be prompted to run the following commands to add brew to your path

  % echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/USER/.zprofile
  % eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
  
From here, we can begin to install additional packages that will be useful to us, including:

  - The GNU compiler suite
  - TexLive
  - rsync
  - cmake
  - and many more

  % brew install gcc        #installs GNU compiler suite (needed for C/C++/Fortran codes)
  % brew install grace      #installs XMGrace plotting software (legacy)
  % brew install git        #installs full git functionality
  % brew install git-gui    #installs gitk for visual representation of git file trees
  % brew install wget       #installs wget command (web retrieval)
  % brew install sshguard   #installs sshguard to protect against brute force ssh attacks 
  % brew install rsync      #installs rsync command and functionality (stop/start file transfer)
  % brew install cmake      #installs cmake library (needed for compiling code with cmake files)
  % brew install cmake-docs #installs cmake documentation
  % brew install aspell     #installs GNU aspell spell checker
