Installation notes for conda on M1 MacBook Pro

More information about Anaconda and its python distribution can be found here:
https://www.anaconda.com/

To install Anaconda on M1 MacBook Pro, follow conda guide at:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html

Once installed, further packages can be installed via pip

It is necessary to create several new conda environments to install specific
packages, including MISFITS and the JWST reduction pipeline

To create a new environment named ENV with conda execute:

  % conda create --no-default-packages -n ENV python
  
To allow newly created environments to be selected for new Jupyter notebooks,
we must install a few additional packages to our environments. In our base
environment, install nb_conda_kernels via:

  % conda install nb_conda_kernels
  
Then, in each environment you want to appear in the Jupyter drop-down menu,
install ipykernel via:

  % conda activate ENV
  % conda install ipykernel
  
Note: This method will only work if you install the ipykernel in each new conda
environment you create. If you cannot install ipykernel becuase of a conflict or
do not wish to install it in an environment, kernels must be registered via:

  % ipython kernel install --user --name=new-env
  
Kernels can be unregistered via:

  % jupyter kernelspec uninstall new-env
